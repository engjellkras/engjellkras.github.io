        <h2>The Champions League Quarter-finals Arsenal VS Real Madrid</h2>
        <p>It's starting to get heated over in the biggest stage of them all.
            Only 8 teams left fighting to get the biggest trophy in club football.
            Barcelona, Real Madrid, Arsenal, Inter, Bayern Munchen, Dortmund, 
            Aston Villa and PSG are the 8 big names left and it has been
            a very different competition than the previous years. With 
            the big change of the wgolechampions league format, there have
            been CRAZY games. Arsenal with a DEVESTATING home win against the 
            holding champions. A crushing 3-0 win with 2 absolute screamers
            from none other than Declan Rice. Not the first,but also his second ever 
            direct freekick of his football career. We are patiently waiting
            to see what is going to happen in Santiago Bernabeu!
